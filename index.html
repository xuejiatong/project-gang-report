    <p>From the last sprint, we were able to improve the number of stories we shipped in the span of this sprint, improve communications, and create better estimates of the number of points weâ€™d like to allocate to each story.</p>
    <h3><u>Traffic analysis: </u></h3>
	  <p>For traffic analysis, we started off by using Google Analytics. We connected Google Analytics to our website but we had difficulties getting any metrics using it. Afterwards, we decided to develop our own analytics tracker as one of our sprint goals. While we put a lot of time and effort into writing it, we ran into several errors that made it so our
	  tracker does not function as expected. Nevertheless, the progress we have made on this part is contained in our repository.</p>
    <h3><u>Donate/Support A/B test results: </u></h3>
	  <p>Overall, our team found this to be the most difficult portion of the project. Our initial thoughts were to use Google Analytics's built-in features to conduct the A/B test. However, we were not able to get the Analytics tracker working as intended. Developing our own A/B test from scratch was too advanced of a task for our team to implement.</p>
